# func-visualizer
a python program based on pygame that visualizes the sine, cosine, and tangent functions in a p cool way
# IMPORTANT
requires the modules appJar and pygame to function properly at the moment. I plan on migrating everything to tkinter soon, however.

just run the program from the command line like:

python funcVisualizer.py

and watch the magic happen.
